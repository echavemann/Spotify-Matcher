# Spotify-Matcher

Spotify Webapp, powered by Google Sheets API and Spotipy.

Our Python script invokes the user to log in to Spotify. Then, using the Spotipy API, we find the top tracks and top genres over multiple time periods. This data is briefly processed and uploaded to a Google Sheets. This takes advantage of the Google Sheets API to display song and genre information.
